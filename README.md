# Why I chose this as a project?
After my second year in Technical University of Sofia I had summer practice in the SAP company.
Mentor gave me this assignment and I had the opportunity to use whatever technology I'd like.
This was my first serious project using the Spring Framework and I learned a lot!
I had a lot of fun working on this project.

# Requirements:
- MySQL Workbench server running on 3306 port (Set password in application.properties file)
- HeidiSQL (Optional) to look and easily edit the DB
- IntelliJ IDEA IDE with Java 11 SDK

# SQL 
The application only supports registering users as clients.
If you want to add an admin you have to do it via the MySQL database.
